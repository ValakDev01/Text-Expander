# Text Expander Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This project is a simple React application that features a TextExpander component. The component allows users to toggle between collapsed and expanded text states, displaying a shortened version of the text by default and revealing the full content when a button is clicked. Each instance of the TextExpander can be customized with different settings, including the number of words shown when collapsed, button text, button color, and initial expanded state. It offers a flexible way to manage large blocks of text and enhance the user experience by minimizing on-screen content.
